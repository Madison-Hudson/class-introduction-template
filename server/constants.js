  ["You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee. You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously","But seriously, happy to have you here! My background is in Environmental Biology and Education. I was part of the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp a few years back and the biggest thing that I learned is that there was still a lot to learn."," I am a proud Daddy of a beautiful little girl, a music lover, avid hiker, yoga dude, fan of fermentation and one who wears many, many hats."
