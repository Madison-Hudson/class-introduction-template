      <p1 class="paragraph"style="background-color:white;">Hi, I'm Madison! About a year and a half ago I decided I was ready to learn to code after graduating with a business degree and working in customer service. I attended a coding bootcamp in Durham that ended in December 2019. We learned to build full stack applications focusing on Javascript and since then I've been working with C# and .NET as contractor for a maritime company. My hobbies include cooking new recipes, exploring local trails, and watching way too much 90 Day Fiance.<p1>
